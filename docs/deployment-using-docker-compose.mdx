# Deployment Using Docker Compose

Appsemble is published as a Docker image. This makes it easy to deploy using Docker Compose. Copy
the following contents in a file named _.docker-compose.yaml_.

```yaml
version: '3.3'

services:
  appsemble:
    image: appsemble/appsemble:latest
    depends_on:
      - postgresql
    restart: always
    environment:
      DATABASE_NAME: appsemble_database_name
      DATABASE_USER: appsemble_database_user
      DATABASE_PASSWORD: appsemble_database_password
    ports:
      # Expose Appsemble at port 8000.
      - '8000:9999'

  postgresql:
    image: postgres:11
    restart: always
    environment:
      POSTGRES_DB: appsemble_database_name
      POSTGRES_USER: appsemble_database_user
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: appsemble_database_password
    volumes:
      - ./postgresql_data:/var/lib/postgresql/data
    ports:
      - '5432:5432'
```

It is highly recommended to specify the version of the `appsemble/appsemble` image to use. Replace
`latest` with a specific version. All available versions can be found on [Appsemble tags page][] on
Docker Hub.

It is also recommended to modify the database name, user, and password.

To start the service, run the following command.

```
$ docker-compose up -d
```

The Appsemble studio should now be available on http://localhost:8000.

The database needs to be migrated to the current version first. This can be done by running:

```sh
$ docker run -ti appsemble/appsemble:latest migrate
```

To stop the service, run the following command.

```
$ docker-compose down
```

Once Appsemble is up and running, you probably to upload blocks. For this, clone the Appsemble git
repository and continue to the
[Blocks in the readme](https://gitlab.com/appsemble/appsemble/blob/master/README.md#blocks).
