# Developing Blocks

## Initialize the Project

<!--
XXX: To be replaced with `yarn create appsemble` when the tooling is ready to be published to npm.
-->

To start developing blocks, first the Appsemble repository needs to be cloned and installed as per
the [Getting Started](https://gitlab.com/appsemble/appsemble/blob/master/README.md#getting-started)
instructions in the readme.

<!--
XXX: It should be possible to simply use a `dev` version to load unpublished blocks in test apps.
-->

Next, publish the existing blocks following the instructions from the
[Blocks](https://gitlab.com/appsemble/appsemble/blob/master/README.md#blocks) section.

## Create Your First Block

A new block can be bootstrapped by running the following command.

```sh
yarn create-appsemble block
```

This will prompt some questions about the new block. For now, lets bootstrap a vanilla JavaScript
block using the block name `test` and organization name `org`. The output should look like this:

```
? For which organization is the block? org
? What should be the name of the block? test
? What kind of block project should be bootstrapped? vanilla
```

The block will be created in the _blocks/_ directory. Its version will be `0.0.0`.

Now, the block needs to be built and registered before it can be used. It can be built using this
command.

```sh
yarn block test
```

Make sure the local Appsemble server is running, then run the following to publish the newly created
block.

```sh
yarn appsemble block register blocks/test
```

## Testing the Block

Open the Appsemble studio on at the base URL of Appsemble. Login, and create your first app. This
following example app will display your new block.

```yaml
name: Test App
defaultPage: Home

pages:
  - name: Home
    blocks:
      - type: '@org/test'
        version: 0.0.0
        actions:
          onClick:
            type: link
            to: Other Page
  - name: Other Page
    blocks:
      - type: '@org/test'
        version: 0.0.0
        actions:
          onClick:
            type: link
            to: Home
```

Enter this app definition, save it, and it should display the new block in the app preview. The app
contains two pages that link to each other by clicking the button created by the new test block. ✨

> **Note**: You may have noticed the block already has the `button` class and a specific style. This
> is because Appsemble automatically injects the [Bulma][] CSS framework and [Font Awesome][] into
> each block. It is possible, recommended even, to use Bulma classes to add minimal styling to your
> block. This allows app builders and organizations to add custom styling when they use your block.

## Modifying the Block

Now lets make the text of the button configurable using the app definition.

```diff
  button.type = 'button';
- button.innerText = 'Click me!';
+ button.innerText = block.parameters.text || 'Click me!';
  button.classList.add('button');
```

In the app definition, specify the value of the parameter.

```yaml
name: Test App
defaultPage: Home

pages:
  - name: Home
    blocks:
      - type: '@org/test'
        version: 0.0.0
        parameters:
          text: Go to the other page.
        actions:
          onClick:
            type: link
            to: Other Page
  - name: Other Page
    blocks:
      - type: '@org/test'
        version: 0.0.0
        parameters:
          text: Go to the home page.
        actions:
          onClick:
            type: link
            to: Home
```

It may be interesting to show content from the context that the page was linked to. Blocks can pass
data to dispatched actions. This data is then available ad the `data` object in the next block.

Let’s to a little rewrite of our block.

```diff
  import { attach } from '@appsemble/sdk';

  attach(({ actions, block, data, events, pageParameters, shadowRoot, utils }) => {
+   const wrapper = document.createElement('div');
+   const text = document.createElement('p');
    const button = document.createElement('button');
+   text.innerText = data ? `I was linked from ${data.text}` : 'I was loaded without data';
    button.type = 'button';
    button.innerText = 'Click me!';
    button.innerText = block.parameters.text;
    button.classList.add('button');
    button.addEventListener(
      'click',
      event => {
        event.preventDefault();
-       actions.onClick.dispatch();
+       actions.onClick.dispatch(block.parameters);
      },
      true,
    );
-   return button;
+   wrapper.appendChild(text);
+   wrapper.appendChild(button);
+   return wrapper;
  });
```

As you can see, the button is now wrapped by a wrapper element. There is also a new text element. If
the block received data, the text will render the text property of the received data.

When the click action if dispatched, the block parameters are passed as the context to the action.
In our example app, the test block on the other page will render this when the user navigates
between pages.

Appsemble also injects some utility functions. For example, it is possible to show a message. Let’s
add a delay and a message when the user is navigating to the other page.

```diff
  button.addEventListener(
    'click',
    event => {
      event.preventDefault();
-     actions.onClick.dispatch(block.parameters);
+     utils.showMessage('Handling click actions in 5 seconds…');
+     setTimeout(() => actions.onClick.dispatch(block.parameters), 5000);
    },
    true,
  );
```

Blocks may communicate with each other by emitting and listening on events. Let’s modify the event
so the click event will emit a `button-click` event instead. We’ll also add a listener using
`events.on()`. This will log the block’s own parameters and the data received from the event.

```diff
  import { attach } from '@appsemble/sdk';

  attach(({ actions, block, data, events, pageParameters, shadowRoot, utils }) => {
    const wrapper = document.createElement('div');
    const text = document.createElement('p');
    const button = document.createElement('button');
    text.innerText = data ? `I was linked from ${data.text}` : 'I was loaded without data';
    button.type = 'button';
    button.innerText = 'Click me!';
    button.innerText = block.parameters.text;
    button.classList.add('button');
+   events.on('button-click', data => {
+     console.log('My parameters:', block.parameters);
+     console.log('Event data:', data);
+   });
    button.addEventListener(
      'click',
      event => {
        event.preventDefault();
+       events.emit('button-click', block.parameters);
-       utils.showMessage('Handling click actions in 5 seconds…');
-       setTimeout(() => actions.onClick.dispatch(block.parameters), 5000);
      },
      true,
    );
    wrapper.appendChild(text);
    wrapper.appendChild(button);
    return wrapper;
  });
```

The event will be emitted to all blocks on the page. Go on and add a second `@org/test` block the
the page to see the event is received by both blocks.

## Unused Variables

The attach function in the example block still has 2 unused variables.

`shadowRoot` is the HTML shadow root on which the block is rendered. The returned value will be
attached to the shadow root automatically, but it may be necessary to append child elements to the
shadow root manually for more advanced use cases. Some use cases are when code needs to be run after
the node has been attached, or when multiple nodes are appended.

`pageParameters` is passed in if the block is rendered on a page that has the `parameters` property
specified. Typically, this is used if a block needs to display data for a single resource, such as a
detail view or an update form.

<!-- XXX: Render the JSDoc -->

For more details on what a block can do, see the technical documentation of the SDK.
