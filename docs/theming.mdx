# Theming Apps

By default Appsemble provides a default style based on the [Bulma CSS framework](bulma). While this
is completely functional for end users, developers may be interested in further spicing up their
applications by applying their own style and branding.

To support this, Appsemble supports customizing the styling in two different ways: Theme options for
setting basic colors and custom styling for advanced or more specific styling.

## Theme options

The Bulma CSS framework uses a set of colors for different parts of its elements. Appsemble supports
customizing a subset of these variables by including a `theme` object at different points within an
app recipe.

The supported variables are:

- themeColor
- splashColor
- primaryColor
- linkColor
- successColor
- infoColor
- warningColor
- dangerColor
- tileLayer

The `themeColor` and `splashColor` variables are not visible at all times. These define the colors
that appear when starting up the app after installing it on a mobile device.

Each variable can be assigned with a [hexadecimal value][hex] representing the desired color.

They can be accessed in the CSS using custom variables using kebab-case, for example:
`background-color: var(--primary-color)`. An appropriately readable shade for the text of each color
can be found by appending `-invert` to the variable name.

Aside from color-related theme properties, the ‘tile layer’ used on components that display a map
(such as `map` and `form`) can be customized using the `tileLayer` property by specifying a ‘URL
template’.

### Example

```yaml
theme:
  primaryColor: '#229954'  # Green
  linkColor: '#D68910'     # Orange
  successColor: '#76448A'  # Purple
pages:
  - name: Red Page
    theme:
      primaryColor: '#FF0000' # Red
    blocks:
      - type: example
        version: 0.0.0
        theme:
          primaryColor: '#0000FF' # Blue
      - type: example
        ...
      ...
  - name: Some Other Page
    ...
```

The above example sets the app´s primary color to green, the color of its links to orange and the
color of ´success´ elements to purple. The page `Red Page` overwrites the primary color to be red
and one of its blocks overwrites the primary color to be blue instead.

If a theme variable is not overwritten, it will simply use the theme of its parent.

> Note: The above example does not represent a full app. It is merely a representation of how app
> themes can be defined.

### Bulma Extensions

On top of the base Bulma framework, extensions have been added that also benefit from all the
variables Bulma uses. The list of extensions is as follows:

- [Checkradio](https://wikiki.github.io/form/checkradio/)

### Appsemble classes

In addition to Bulma classes, Appsemble has defined the following classes in the core part of
Appsemble. These may also be used for styling.

| CSS Class               | Context               | Description                |
| ----------------------- | --------------------- | -------------------------- |
| `.bottom-nav`           | Bottom app navigation | The container element.     |
| `.bottom-nav-item`      | Bottom app navigation | A navigation list item.    |
| `.bottom-nav-item-link` | Bottom app navigation | A link inside a list item. |

## Custom Styling

Custom styling is supported using a hierarchical model by allowing developers to upload CSS which
gets injected during the runtime of an application. Stylesheets can be uploaded at **three different
levels** and can be injected at **three different points** within applications.

### Hierarchy

<img
  src={require('./images/theming-hierarchy.svg')}
  style={{ float: 'right', maxHeight: '570px', maxWidth: '150px' }}
/>

Applications can be styled at a **server** level, **organization** level as well as the
**app-specific** level. Within each level, styling can be further specified for **core** modules,
**block** modules and **shared** modules.

#### Levels

**Server**-level styling gets applied to every application hosted on the Appsemble server. This is
useful for quickly applying style changes without having to re-deploy the server.

**Organization**-level styling gets applied to every application that belongs to a specific
organization. This is useful for applying unified styling across every application within an
organization, such as for supplying basic color themes and icons.

**App**-level styling gets applied to one specific application. This is primarily used for any
styling that is directly related to one specific application without influencing any other
applications. App-level styling overrides any styling applied at organization and server levels.

#### Modules

**Core**-module styling gets applied to any part of an Appsemble application not related to a block,
such as the navigation bar, side menu, login view, message toasts, etc. The styling applied to the
core modules _do not_ get applied to blocks.

**Block**-module styling gets applied to a specific block.

**Shared**-module styling gets applied to each individual block as well as the Appsemble core
modules. This is useful for applying styles to elements that can appear in both the core modules as
well as blocks, such as input fields. It can also be used to apply [CSS variables][css-variables]

### Applying themes for an application

Open the Appsemble studio located at the base URL of Appsemble. Login, and create your first app.
Within the editor, tabs for `shared` and `core` are available. These tabs contain the current
styling for these modules. Tabs containing styling for specific blocks are automatically added and
removed depending on which blocks are used within the app recipe.

To preview a style change, simply enter CSS in the corresponding tabs and press the `Save` button.
If the styling is satisfactory, it can be uploaded to the application by pressing the `Upload`
button.

Example shared styling:

```css
.input,
.button {
  border-radius: 0;
  box-shadow: 5px 5px #888888;
  font-family: serif;
}
```

Example core styling:

```css
.navbar {
  background-color: var(--primary-color) !important;
}

.navbar-item {
  color: var(--primary-color-invert) !important;
  padding: 0 !important;
}
```

Example block styling for `@appsemble/form`:

```css
form {
  max-width: initial !important;
  padding: 0 !important;
}

.field.is-horizontal {
  box-sizing: border-box;
  max-width: 100vw;
  padding: 0.5em 1em;
}
```

### Applying themes for an organization

Organization themes can be uploaded using the [CLI](cli). The command for uploading themes is as
follows:

```sh
yarn appsemble theme upload [path-to-theme-css] --organization [organization-id] [--shared|--core|--block @organization/blockname]
```

More detailed information about the meaning of each parameter can be found using the following
command:

```sh
yarn appsemble theme upload --help
```

### Applying themes for server
