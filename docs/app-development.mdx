# App Development

Apps can be created and modified using the Appsemble studio. This can be found at the base URL of
Appsemble.

After logging in a list of apps you can manage will appear, providing direct links to the app itself
as well as the corresponding editor pages.

From this screen new apps can be created by clicking on the grayed out _”Create new app”_ card.

By clicking on the create app card, a form is presented in which the following attributes can be
filled in:

**App Name**: This is the name of the app. It determines the URL at which the app will be made
available as well as the name that shows up when installing it. Note that app names must be unique.

**Organization**: Each app belongs to an organization. This is used to determine the which rights
users have for certain apps such as the ability to modify them. By default every user belongs to
their own organization. If the user is in multiple organizations, the organization can be selected
using a dropdown menu.

**App Template**: The template determines what the initial app looks like. This can range from a
very simple app that does not do very much to a more complex app that is provided with
authentication, uploading files, etc.

After filling in these fields and clicking the _”Create App”_ button, Appsemble redirects to the
editor page corresponding to the newly created app.

## App studio

The app studio is an environment where apps can be modified, previewed, and updated. On the
left-hand side it displays the definitions that make up an app and the right-hand side displays a
preview of what the app will look like based on these definitions.

Apps are defined using a data serialization language called `YAML`. To learn more about how YAML
works, please refer to [this page][yaml].

The _”Recipe”_ tab contains the app definition in YAML. Changes can be made to the app definition by
editing them in this tab and pressing the _”Save”_ button. Doing so will replace the app definition
in the right-hand panel with the new one, serving as a preview of the changes that have been made.
Note that some functionality such as the [resource API](appsemble-resources) when defining new
resources might not be available unless the new app definition has been uploaded to the server.

The other tabs that are available such as the _”Core”_ and _”Shared”_ tabs refer to the Theming API.
For more information about this, please refer to [this page](theming).

Provided the app definition and styles successfully validated, the _”Upload”_ button will upload all
this data to the server, effectively updating the app.

## Example app

An app definition at the very least contains a name and a list of `pages`.

Each `page` is provided with a name as well as a list of `blocks`.

A `block` is specified by a type as well as a version. The type follows the format of
`@organization/name`. If the organization is `appsemble`, it may be omitted. A `block` may also have
other properties such as named parameters and actions. The significance of these fields depends on
which blocks are being used.

With this knowledge in mind, let's compose a simple app in which basic information about people can
be registered.

First, define a resource that represents the format of a `person` resource:

```yaml
resources:
  person:
    schema:
      type: object
      required:
        - firstName
        - lastName
        - email
      properties:
        firstName:
          type: string
        lastName:
          type: string
        email:
          type: string
          format: email
        description:
          type: string
```

This creates a _”person”_ resource which contains a first name, a last name, an email address, an
age, and a description. For more information about how resources work, please refer to
[this page](appsemble-resources).

Next, add a new page containing `list` block used to display all the resources that are available:

```yaml
defaultPage: Person List

pages:
  - name: Person List
    blocks:
      - type: list
        version: 0.9.4
        parameters:
          fields:
            - name: firstName
              label: First Name
            - name: lastName
              label: Surname
        actions:
          onLoad:
            type: resource.query
            resource: person
```

Saving and uploading the app at this point will result in no resources being displayed due to the
fact that there aren't any available.

Let's follow up by adding a page in which resources can be registered.

```yaml
- name: Person Registration Form
  blocks:
    - type: form
      version: 0.9.4
      actions:
        onSubmit:
          type: resource.create
          resource: person
        onSubmitSuccess:
          to: Person List
          type: link
      parameters:
        fields:
          - label: First Name
            name: firstName
            type: string
          - label: Surname
            name: lastName
            type: string
          - label: Email
            name: email
            type: string
          - label: Description
            multiline: true
            name: description
            type: string
```

To summarize this page: It contains a `form` block in which various fields of specific types are
defined. These fields match up with the resource definition defined before. The form block contains
two actions. The first action is _”submit”_ which describes where the resource will be submitted to.
This can be sent to any API, but in this case it's being sent to Appsemble's resource API. Upon a
successful submit, the page will link back to the _”Person List”_ page as described in
\_”submitSuccess”.

At this point it might become noticeable how navigating through these pages can be cumbersome. One
way to make this easier is to add an `action-button` block to both pages that refer to each other.
Clicking it results in being redirected to the other page.

```yaml
- type: action-button
  version: 0.9.4
  parameters:
    icon: plus
  actions:
    onClick:
      to: Person Registration Form # Or `Person List` in case of the Person Registration Form
      type: link
```

Since the `list` block only displays one field at a time, it might be desirable to be able to click
on a resource and view more details about this resource. To facilitate this, let's add another page
that is able to display a resource.

```yaml
- name: Person Details
  parameters:
    - id
  blocks:
    - type: detail-viewer
      version: 0.9.4
      actions:
        onLoad:
          type: resource.get
          resource: person
      parameters:
        fields:
          - name: firstName
            label: First Name
          - name: lastName
            label: Surname
          - name: email
            label: Email Address
          - name: description
            label: Description
```

The structure of this page is the same as any other page with the exception of the `id` parameter.
This is used to determine which resource to load.

The `detail-viewer` block is able to display various types of fields based on the type specified in
the resource definition. In this example it simply displays every available field, but other fields
may also be hidden by removing it from the `fields` parameter.

Finally, in order to link the `list` block to the _”Person Details”_ page, add a click action to its
list of actions:

```yaml
onClick:
  to: Person Details
  type: link
```

The final result should look like this:

```yaml
name: Person App
defaultPage: Person List

resources:
  person:
    schema:
      type: object
      required:
        - firstName
        - lastName
        - email
      properties:
        firstName:
          type: string
        lastName:
          type: string
        email:
          type: string
          format: email
        description:
          type: string

pages:
  - name: Person List
    blocks:
      - type: list
        version: 0.9.4
        parameters:
          fields:
            - name: firstName
              label: First Name
            - name: lastName
              label: Surname
        actions:
          onClick:
            to: Person Details
            type: link
          onLoad:
            type: resource.query
            resource: person
      - type: action-button
        version: 0.9.4
        parameters:
          icon: plus
        actions:
          click:
            to: Person Registration Form
            type: link

  - name: Person Registration Form
    blocks:
      - type: form
        version: 0.9.4
        actions:
          onSubmit:
            type: resource.create
            resource: person
          onSubmitSuccess:
            to: Person List
            type: link
        parameters:
          fields:
            - label: First Name
              name: firstName
              type: string
            - label: Surname
              name: lastName
              type: string
            - label: Email
              name: email
              type: string
            - label: Description
              multiline: true
              name: description
              type: string

  - name: Person Details
    parameters:
      - id
    blocks:
      - type: detail-viewer
        version: 0.9.4
        actions:
          onLoad:
            type: resource.get
            resource: person
        parameters:
          fields:
            - name: firstName
              label: First Name
            - name: lastName
              label: Surname
            - name: email
              label: Email Address
            - name: description
              label: Description
```
