# Appsemble Resources

Appsemble provides its own method of storing and retrieving data specific to apps. Data that is
created via an app is called a ´resource´.

## Defining Resources

Resources can be defined within an [app recipe](reference/app) within the `resources` property. Each
object within `resources` is considered to be a Resource, named after the name it is given within
`resources`.

The shape of a resource is defined using [JSON Schema](https://json-schema.org/). This makes it
possible for submitted data to be validated on types and required properties automatically.

An example of a resource definition:

```yaml
person:
  schema:
    type: object
    required:
      - firstName
      - lastName
      - email
    properties:
      firstName:
        type: string
      lastName:
        type: string
      email:
        type: string
        format: email
      age:
        type: integer
      description:
        type: string
```

The above resource will be recognized as an object which can be referred to from blocks using
`$ref: /resources/person` or by using `resource actions`. It can be accessed in the API at
`/api/apps/{appId}/resources/person/{id?}`, supporting basic `CRUD` actions.

## Resource Actions

In order to make the usage of resources more convenient, Appsemble supports the usage of
`resource actions`. Resource actions are actions that can fetch, modify, create or delete resources.
These are configured to use Appsemble APIs by default, but can be overridden manually if need be.

The resource actions available are:

- **resource.query**: Fetch all resources.
- **resource.get**: Fetch a single resource.
- **resource.create**: Create a new resource.
- **resource.update**: Update an existing resource.
- **resource.delete**: Delete an existing resource.

To customize which data to use, you can do this by simply adding this to the root of a resource
object:

```yaml
person:
  schema: ... # see schema above
  id: id # the name of the field to use when calling get, update and delete
  url: '/api/apps/{appId}/resources/person' # the default URL to use for resource actions
  query:
    method: 'GET' # HTTP method to use
    url: '/api/apps/{appId}/resources/person'
  get:
    method: 'GET'
    url: '/api/apps/{appId}/resources/person'
  # create:
  #   ...
  # update:
  #   ...
```

## Filtering Resources

When fetching resources at `/api/apps/{appId}/resources/{resourceName}`, by default all resources
are obtained. The data that is retrieved can be further specified using a subset of the
[OData URL syntax](http://docs.oasis-open.org/odata/odata/v4.01/odata-v4.01-part2-url-conventions.html).

The following OData syntaxes are supported:

### Boolean Operators

- [x] `AND`
- [x] `OR`
- [ ] `NOT`

### Comparison Operators

- [x] Equal (`eq`)
- [x] Not Equal (`ne`)
- [x] Greater Than (`gt`)
- [x] Greater Than or Equal (`ge`)
- [x] Less Than (`lt`)
- [x] Less Than or Equal (`le`)

### Functions

1. String Functions

- [x] `substringof`
- [ ] `endswith`
- [x] `startswith`
- [x] `tolower`
- [x] `toupper`
- [x] `trim`
- [ ] `concat`
- [ ] `substring`
- [ ] `replace`
- [ ] `indexof`

2. Date Functions

- [x] `day`
- [x] `hour`
- [x] `minute`
- [x] `month`
- [x] `second`
- [x] `year`

### Others

- [x] Complex query with precedence
- [x] `top`
- [x] `select`
- [x] `filter`
- [x] `skip`
- [ ] `expand`

## Assets

Some resources may also include files such as images or documents. To support this, Appsemble
provides the Asset API. The asset API accepts file uploads and returns the corresponding ID which
can be referenced to within a resource.

The Asset API can be found at `/assets/{id?}`.
